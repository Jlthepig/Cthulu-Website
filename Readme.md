To clone the repository directly into the `C:/` directory, open your command prompt and run the following command:

```cmd
cd C:/
git clone https://github.com/LordManjush/Cthulu-Engine-Website.git


This will create a Cthulu-Engine-Website folder in your C:/ directory containing all the project files.
